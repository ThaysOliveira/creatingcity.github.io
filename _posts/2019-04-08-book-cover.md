We started to spread our book in partinership with Springer, is the second volume of the Urban Computing Series. Our group started to realize special sessions and workshops on conferences encompassing Smart Cities themes.
This book was idealized from the exchange of knowledge with researchers and students in conferences, special sessions and workshop over two years.
The opportunity to idealize this book was essencial to show works in Smart and Digital Cities from Computational Intelligence to Applied Social Science.


About our Special Sessions and worskhop:

Proceedings: 
1st Special Session Operations Research and Smart Cities at the XLIX SBPO 2017 –

1st Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Smart Cities (ECISC 2017) held in the 
Congresso Brasileiro de Inteligência Computacional (CBIC 2017) –

About the book:

Presents:

    • State-of-the-art contributions in the field of computational intelligence applied to smart cities;
    • Represents effort of a diverse group of authors, and came from research results of three different
    workshos that were organized regarding this topic;
    • Server as useful source not only for the academic but also to the industry.

Abstract: 
This book presents up-to-date information on the future digital and smart cities. 
In particular, it describes novel insights about the use of computational intelligence techniques and 
decentralized technologies, covering urban aspects and services, cities governance and social sciences. 
The topics covered here range from the state-of-the-art computational techniques to current discussions 
regarding drones, blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. The idealization of this material emerged 
with a journay of free knowledge exchange from a diverse group of authors, who met each other through four 
different events (workshops and special sessions) organized with the purpose of boosting the concepts 
surrounding smart cities. We believe that this book comprises innovative and precise information regarding 
state-of-the-art applications and ideas for the future of cities and society. It will surely be useful not 
only for the academic community but also to the industry professionals and city maners.
